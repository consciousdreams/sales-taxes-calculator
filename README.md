# Project: sales-taxes-calculator

This project is a Java-based application and it has the main purpose of calculating the total amount and tax due for a given list of products.

I used Lombok to create a simply designed java beans model.
Also, JUnit dependency is included to run tests that are invoked by Maven in the Travis CI build.

In the Travis-CI build log, it is possible to check the JUnit results implemented in the "AppTest" class.
